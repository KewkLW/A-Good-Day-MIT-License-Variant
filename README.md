# THE "GOOD DAY" SOFTWARE LICENSE (A Good Day MIT Parody Variant)

Copyright (c) 2024 Kewk Lightworker

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person waking up in the morning, thanking God, and finding that today seems kinda odd (in a good way), to deal in this Software, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and grub out, subject to the following conditions:

**Section 1: No Smog, No Hog**

1.1 If breakfast is involved, said breakfast must include "no hog" unless otherwise explicitly stated by mama. If mama cooks something else, proceed with caution, but be grateful nonetheless.

1.2 The Software may be used only on days when there is no barking from the dog and preferably when the sun is shining brightly and smog-free. If a barking dog is present, take a moment to assess the dog's vibe and try again.

**Section 2: Drop-Top Clause**

2.1 Permission is granted to hit the switch and make the ass drop. If in possession of a drop-top, one must ride with full swag, hitting the corner with ease. Use of three-wheel motion is optional, but encouraged.

2.2 All users must attempt to reach a "red light" without encountering any jackers. If said jackers appear, the license is temporarily revoked until the area is jacker-free.

**Section 3: Basketball & Triple-Doubles**

3.1 All license holders are required to locate a park and ask the homies "which park y'all playin' basketball?" Users are encouraged to mess around and get a triple-double, but this is not a strict requirement. Those who are unable to achieve such status should at least freak brothers like MJ, at their discretion.

3.2 No static should be received from cowards during said activities. In case of cowardly static, authorities will roll right past without flexin', as per Good Day Protocol (GDP).

**Section 4: Game Night Regulations**

4.1 Licensees are encouraged to engage in craps and/or dominoes. The "shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em" methodology must be followed while rolling dice. In the event of "seven," celebrate with appropriate gestures. Licensees must yell "DOMINO" when appropriate, or risk revocation of game night privileges.

**Section 5: Romantic Ventures**

5.1 Should a user "pick up a girl" (or consenting partner of choice), said user must drive to the pad while coastin', enjoying an alcoholic or herbal refreshment as desired (not while driving, obviouslyâ€”we at Good Day Software do not condone that). The potion is to be sipped responsibly, and three-wheel motion should be used to impress partner but not endanger public safety.

**Section 6: AK-Free Day**

6.1 This Software may be used only on days where licensee does not need to use their AK. If the AK is required, the terms of this license are void, as today is no longer deemed a "good day."

6.2 Under no circumstances should licensees throw up, even if "drunk as hell." Good vibes are encouraged, and vomiting is counterproductive to the Good Day Initiative (GDI).

**Section 7: Miscellaneous Provisions**

7.1 The Goodyear Blimp must display positive affirmations such as "[Your Name]'s a Pimp" if available. Should this be impossible, users may simply appreciate the blimp from afar while whispering said affirmations.

7.2 If everything "works out" and you end up with a Fatburger at 2 AM, smile and acknowledge that today truly was a good day.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF SMOG-FREENESS, DROP-TOP SATISFACTION, AND TRIPLE-DOUBLE POTENTIAL. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGE, OR HOG-RELATED DISPUTE ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
